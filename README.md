# Introduction
* Ontology Builder from Schemas
* FronEnd: Angular (9)
* BackEnd: Python + Flask

The objective of this project is the development of an application that can acquire content from a certain user, according to predefined Schemas, 
save the information introduced by the user according to standards that allow the semantic web, as well as the ontology concept. 
With the information collected and properly stored, thus generate information and knowledge ontologies. 
As an interface between user and machine, a web application was developed, supporting the creation of new users as well as their management, 
which will allow the introduction of information per user and the visualization of the collected data.
As a final result it is given the possibility to generate ontologies according to the stored data.

## Objectives
* Comparison of the different vocabularies used/relationed with the semantic web, with the preferential use of schema.org (https://schema.org/) vocabularies;
* Possibility for the user to choose a class (e.g. book, movie, event), define its name (ID) and any details (properties also defined by schema.org) about that item;
* Elaboration of a simple to use interface, easy to choose the class (and possible subclasses) and its properties;
* Storage of the data in a single XML file per user and their respective storage in a database;
* Generate the ontology always dynamically according to the data (and structure) existing in the database (XML file respective to the user);
* Define XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) to present all or part of the ontology information/knowledge;
